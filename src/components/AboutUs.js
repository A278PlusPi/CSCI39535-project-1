        But seriously, I am making this "Disney Magic Kingdoms" pseudo-website for two reasons. One is for my instructors to assess my ability to create websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and two is that I am a true Disney fan as I have watched numerous Disney movies in the past, and played Disney games such as Disney Magic Kingdoms and Disney Dreamlight Valley. As a fan of Disney, I financially supported Disney by purchasing a monthly subscription ($8/month) called Disney+, and bought lots of in-game items (a total of about $500!) in Disney Magic Kingdoms. What an investment that is. If that isn't, you should probably ask Scrooge McDuck.
